                <p>This is the second tab. It is the tab that comes second. The first tab comes before it, and the third tab comes after it. If there was a fourth tab, it would also come after the second tab, but there isn't.</p>

                <p>This is the third tab. It is the tab that comes third. The first and second tabs come before it. There are no tabs after it, but if there was a fourth tab, it would, but there isn't, so it doesn't.</p>

            <h3>Accordion 1</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This is the first part of the accordion. It's the one at the very beginning. See what I wrote in the first tab up top? Basically the same, but for an accordion.</p>
                <p>Don't open the third accordion, by the way. There's a monster.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Accordion 2</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This is the second part of the accordion. Seriously, look at the second tab up top. Same deal.</p>
                <p>And I'm not joking about the third accordion. There is a monster, DON'T open it.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Accordion 3</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Okay, there isn't actually a monster. He's on his lunch break. But if he was here, he'd be terrifying.</p>
